# AMAZON_E-COMMERCE
Amazon Sales Analytics – E-commerce Data Analysis Using mySQL
In this project, I designed and implemented a simple e-commerce database inspired by Amazon’s operations.

The database contains five tables — customers, products, orders, order_items, and payments — each representing a key part of an online shopping system.

This project demonstrates my ability to design relational databases, write efficient SQL queries, and perform foundational business analysis — skills essential for data science and business intelligence roles.

Dataset: Simulated Amazon-style transactional dataset.

Tools Used: MySQL (or SQLite), SQL queries.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

--Database schema design

--Data extraction with JOINs and aggregates

--Business metrics analysis (KPIs)

--Data cleaning and filtering

--Outcome: Insights for business decisions like top customers, sales growth, and market trends.
